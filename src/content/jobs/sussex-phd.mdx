- Conducting doctoral research in applications of NLP with a focus on schema matching and unsupervised assessment of LLM-generated web scraping configurations
- Developed a novel schema matching approach using self-supervised contrastive learning of sentence embeddings with **Hugging Face**; benchmarked against and reproduced multiple state-of-the-art competitors through large-scale experiments on HPC clusters (Slurm, multi-GPU)}
- Introduced a new research task: unsupervised assessment of LLM-generated web scraping configurations, and designed embedding-based similarity measures to detect incorrect configurations
- Experimented with and evaluated LLMs (via **Pydantic AI**) in solving the assessment task, comparing their performance to embedding-based methods
- Fully funded doctoral project, supported by University of Sussex and CASM Technology
