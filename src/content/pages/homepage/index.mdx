Hi, I'm Albertus Andito. I'm a final year PhD candidate in Informatics at the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/) with experience in natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), machine learning (ML), and large-scale data systems.

I also currently work part-time as a researcher and software engineer at [CASM Technology](https://www.casmtechnology.com/) where we work with non-profit organisations to understand and tackle online harms using NLP.

Also, I've been dedicating some of my time to help building and maintaining technology infrastructure of [Doctrine UK](https://doctrineuk.org/), an epistemic organisation for Indonesians pursuing PhD in the UK.

I hail from [Bandung](https://share.google/vlCJ7Cs8dvb2aIW7g), Indonesia and currently live in [Brighton](https://share.google/xI0gWMjUfxbL6TvmH), UK.

I'm always happy to connect and collaborate.
